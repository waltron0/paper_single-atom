- just say "scanned with sub-micron translation stages

Need from lab:
- lin:  with vibe shutter, low BG
- better XeBaXeLarge, I'd say beginning w/ a more mediodre one, then doing a bug one, in case the big one is actually detrimental (and u wanna know that)

- on vibe plots:  20150819 was the first good stuff, but the next was 20160111, and I have so far copied that day's image_ script into one of 420, and changed the dates, but I need to work on it from there.  Chris is also gonna send me output text from his analysis of that day, and also from his vibe data, but he needs new vibe data (accelerometer etc.) which has accel. signal w/o the feedback stuff.
- want to show scanned images of the surface BG holes?
- is bleaching of the 619 disccussed? should it be?
- I now think that the 6.1x10^4 image BaXe is not a good juxtaposition -- should you look on a low level for residual?  It seems like this isn't any different really than showing the XeBaXe of smaller deposits [now I see there is -- many many Ba tage could be similar to one large one here]
-- and more on that:  should we use a different run for this?  It's annoying that there isn't a pre-Xe for it, and thus also Bill's sentence "...the background in the next Xe-only deposit is the same as the Xe-only run before this deposit," which is in the paper (1h) is not actually true.
- may need to specify windows used in a footnote (coming from paragraph where Meller and Rubicon are mentioned)
- tell Bill:  I use the word "intensity" rather than "power" in last paragraph of Apparatus, because:  the intensity is what is defining of the signal from an atom, and I imagine changing the laser area to see that this is what reduces the background while keeping the same signal from an atom (even though practically that means reducing the laser power while focusing it)
- gonna do a better bleaching explanation, but also have a good vibes one?  I think you should show the raw signal w/o the extra junk from the shutter signal, can also overlay the shutter signal but make a note about the junk, and justifying why it is not important
- need doi on all refs, like the one on mccaffrey?
- i can't remember if 1h was in response to Bill's 1g comments...
- um, maybe just re-check power for the large BaXe ... in the thesis I said 0.6 mW, but that seems to be what's in the LV, meaning it's actually more than that (I assume T/R = 2.17 from 1113, and then just 0.89 --> 1.1 mW)
- need 5-26 or new for seeing real linearity?
- is linearity --> not Ba molecule mentioned?  should it be?
- is the precision quoted on the laser w too much?  ho with 2.1 and 2.7?
- cite mccaffrey on 670 line, saying that they attribute it to Ba molecule?  maybe this isn't dangerous for us, since we see this peak in large deposits (we think we don't deposit enough to get molecules in small Ba deposits).

* alter any necessary power quotes, taking out the x1.57 for ones with power meter moved

- check the ions/pulse number quoted
- say "though 620 BP" in all captions?
- have all the refs to parts that are in the other paper?
- check that 6.1E4 image was really dep. at 50K, etc.
- need to talk about 619 bleaching?
- bad if caption has exactly the same text as in thesis?  exactly the same figures?  need some cross-referencing? (prolly won't be same since will use new data)
- prolly need to alter text sizes in figures (do on new data pics)
- really check numbers (of atoms) -- I just did a scaling on all of them based on the one
- make the X, e.g. in image example figure caption, like it is in thesis (spacing-wise)
- someone should double check my wx, wy





OLD:
- re-do vibration measurement after measuring w0 of 532 (w/ fit to far-field), and its z position, and putting the blade there DO IT RIGHT
- really do the Ba+ velocity measurement
- make sure excitspec is really counts, not peak counts
- excitspec could have Cr3+ on it too
* probably should just take out the sensitivity plot and have a reference
- 1st sentence of conclucion:  Ba "in" a...
